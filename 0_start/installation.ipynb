    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "pyGIMLi is a Python library that can be installed on all major platforms, also cloud computing. \n",
    "\n",
    "For installation see webpage https://www.pygimli.org/installation.html\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend conda, either by Anaconda distribution (preferred on Windows) or Miniconda (preferred on Linux or Mac).\n",
    "\n",
    "The current pyGIMLi version v1.4.1 comes along with (depends on) several libraries:\n",
    "* NumPy library for numerical computing https://numpy.org/\n",
    "* SciPy library for scientific computation https://scipy.org/\n",
    "* MatPlotLib visualization package: https://matplotlib.org/\n",
    "* PyVista 3D visualization: https://pyvista.org/\n",
    "* Pandas data manipulation package: https://pandas.pydata.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "I just created a matching pyBERT version v2.4.2 that can be installed along with pyGIMLi and all its dependencies using a single line\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda create -n pg -c gimli -c conda-forge pybert=2.4.2 jupyter spyder\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a new environment named pg and installs pybert and other stuff into it.\n",
    "Note that we included two integrated development environments:\n",
    "* Spyder - a Matlab-like Python IDE: https://www.spyder-ide.org/\n",
    "* Jupyter Notebooks or JupyterLab: https://jupyter.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "On Windows, you can do it step by step by the Anaconda Navigator: First add the channels gimli and conda-forge to the channel list. Then create a new environment and install pybert as well as any other software into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If pybert does not work (or you already did it before), one can install pyGIMLi by creating a new environment and install it \n",
    "```\n",
    "conda create -n pg -c gimli -c conda-forge pygimli=1.4.1 jupyter spyder\n",
    "```\n",
    "To use it we have to activate it and call the IDE\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda activate pg\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then also install pybert later:\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install -c gimli pybert=2.4.2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another alternative is to get pybert (or pygimli) by git (or download a zip file) so that you don't have to wait for a new version. See [This link](https://www.pygimli.org/installation.html#staying-up-to-date)"

    "\n",
    "Historically, we started developing BERT (Rücker et al., 2006; Günther et al., 2006). Subsequently, BERT became one application based on the GIMLi C++ core (pgcore) upon which we later build pyGIMLi (Rücker et al., 2017). Later, the BERT was transferred to Python under the name pyBERT. However, most things were moved to the ERT module, i.e. standard ERT modelling and inversion are done without pyBERT. BERT is mainly \n",
