# pyGIMLi-workshop: DC/IP modelling and inversion with pyGIMLi/pyBERT

Lund University, June 07, 2023

In this repository we collect jupyter notebooks for the workshop, but also for further reading. We will mainly create notebooks from scratch, but these will help to view the entire process and to look for errors.

The whole workshop is based on Jupyter Notebooks.

First start with some introduction and installation stuff at https://github.com/halbmy/pyGIMLi-workshop/blob/main/0_start/installation.ipynb

Then we proceed with some basic stuff. Just go to the different subfolders.
